    "The file contains two streams: a video container and an audio stream. The file's well-formedness is declared 'null' but the validator has set a grading value of 'fi-dpres-acceptable-file-format' for the file which implies that even though the file si recognised, it can not be appraised neither as well-formed not not well-formed. This is a logical conflict and implies that there is a problem with the validating software because the acceptable grade should result in a decisive result for well-formedness."
