    "From https://stackoverflow.com/a/76222700: The 'non monotonically increasing dts' issue is mainly a result of streaming the input video file in a loop. Each time the loop starts, the timestamps starts from the beginning. The remuxing procedure copies the timestamps from the input to the output, so there is a 'non-increased DTS scenario' each time the loop restarts."
