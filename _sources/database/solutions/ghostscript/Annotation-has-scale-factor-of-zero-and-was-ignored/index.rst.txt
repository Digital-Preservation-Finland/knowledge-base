Analysis
========



There have been cases where tools like PyMuPDF do not find any annotations in the file, but Ghostscript still prints this warning. In other cases the files have actual annotations, which are broken. Further analysis is needed.

Is it a bug in the validating software? - no

Remove annotations with Ghostscript
===================================

Suggestion
~~~~~~~~~~

Remove the annotations using Ghostscript.

Effects
~~~~~~~

All annotations are removed. Ghostscript will convert the file from PDF to PostScript and back to PDF again. The file may lose other features in the process.

Justification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file will now be valid, however, you lose all annotations.

Execution example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	gs -o <fixed file>.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dPreserveAnnots=false <broken_file>.pdf
